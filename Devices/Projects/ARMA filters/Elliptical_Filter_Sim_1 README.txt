Elliptical_Filter_Sim_1 README

Elliptical_Filter_Sim_1.mlappinstall is a MATLAB application created by Shai Ben-Ami in June 2025 as a part of the paper: "Reconfigurable Silicon Photonic Filter Stage for Signal Processing and Monitoring", by the authors: Matan Slook, Saawan Kumar Bag, Leroy Dokhanian, Shai Ben-Ami, Inbar Shafir, Maayan Holsblat, Abhinand Venugopalan, Janosch Meier, Khaleda Mallick, Thomas Schneider and Avi Zadok.
Elliptical filter is a type of analog filter used in communication and data processing systems. This tool was used to adjust the parameters of such a filter in a photonic integrated circuit.

NOTE: This application works only in MATLAB version R2019a and on.
NOTE: To install this application, you should download the file 'Elliptical_Filter_Sim_1.mlappinstall'. If it is downloaded as a zip, simply erase the suffix '.zip' from the file, and then double click it. MATLAB will open and ask if you want to add Elliptical_Filter_Sim_1 to your apps. Click 'yes'.
NOTE: Using this application is fairly simple - set the desired phases of the four ring resonators consisting the elliptical filter by dragging the controller / typing the desired value / scrolling using the arrows. Usually it is beneficial to set phases 3&4 as the opposite of phases 1&2, respectively. This can be done by clicking the 'Lock Phases' button.
