# Zadok_Lab repository  
## The basics
+ In order to create gds files easily we code with python.  
+ We use git for updates and unified versions of the code we write to manage and follow it (avoiding mishmash).  


## Downloading stuff
>Download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/)  

After installation, open "Anaconda Prompt" terminal (similar to cmd - just write it in the search bar).  
In this terminal type: `conda install -c conda-forge gdspy` - this will install the gds library we are using.  
After the installation is finished, open **Spyder** enviorment (you should have it if you installed Anaconda).  
If you don't have Spyder download from [here](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)  

Register for an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), and download GitHub desktop.
