# Zadok_Lab repository  
## 

In order to code with python and create gds files we are working with python.  
Download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/)   
After installation, open "Anaconda Prompt" terminal (similar to cmd - just write it in the search bar).  
In this terminal type: `conda install -c conda-forge gdspy`  
this will install the gds library we are using.  
After the installation is finished, open Spyder enviorment (you should have it if you installed Anaconda) and script away.  
If you don't have Spyder download from: https://www.spyder-ide.org/
