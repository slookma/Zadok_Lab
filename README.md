## The basics
+In order to create gds files easily we code with python.  
+We use git for updates and unified versions of the code we write to manage and follow it.  


## Downloading stuff
Download Anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/)   
After installation, open "Anaconda Prompt" terminal (similar to cmd - just write it in the search bar).  
In this terminal type: `conda install -c conda-forge gdspy`  
this will install the gds library we are using.  
After the installation is finished, open Spyder enviorment (you should have it if you installed Anaconda) and script away.  
If you don't have Spyder download from: https://www.spyder-ide.org/
